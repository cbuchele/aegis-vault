Aegis Vault üõ°Ô∏è
Secure, LGPD-compliant middleware for protecting sensitive data in LLM prompts. Aegis Vault automatically detects, redacts, and encrypts sensitive information before it reaches LLM APIs, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

‚ú® Features
üîç Automatic detection of sensitive data (CPF, CNPJ, emails, etc.)
üîí Secure encryption of sensitive information
üõ°Ô∏è Protection against prompt injection and data leaks
üîÑ Easy restoration of original content in LLM responses
üöÄ Simple integration with any LLM workflow
üáßüá∑ Optimized for Brazilian data protection (LGPD)
üîê What It Does
Aegis Vault provides a secure middleware layer between your application and LLMs:

Detects sensitive data using regex patterns and NER (Named Entity Recognition)
Redacts and encrypts PII before sending to LLMs
Securely stores encrypted data in a local vault
Restores redacted content in LLM responses
Blocks malicious inputs including prompt injection and DoS patterns
LGPD-compliant with special focus on Brazilian Portuguese data
üì¶ Installation
Install using pip:

Bash

pip install aegis-vault
üöÄ Quick Start
Basic Usage
Python

from aegis_vault import VaultGPT

# Initialize the vault with default settings
vault = VaultGPT()

# Process a prompt securely
def my_llm_function(prompt):
    # This is where you would call your actual LLM
    return f"Processed: {prompt}"

# Sensitive data will be automatically detected and protected
response = vault.secure_chat(
    "Meu CPF √© 123.456.789-00 e meu email √© usuario@exemplo.com.br",
    my_llm_function
)

print(response)
# Output: Processed: Meu CPF √© 123.456.789-00 e meu email √© usuario@exemplo.com.br
Advanced Usage
Python

from aegis_vault import VaultGPT

# Initialize with custom encryption key
vault = VaultGPT(encryption_key="my-secret-key-123")

# Redact sensitive information from text
redacted = vault.redact_prompt(
    "Por favor, envie um email para usuario@exemplo.com informando sobre o CPF 123.456.789-00"
)
print(f"Redacted: {redacted}")
# Output: Redacted: Por favor, envie um email para <<VAULT_0>> informando sobre o CPF <<VAULT_1>>

# Restore original content
restored = vault.restore_content(redacted)
print(f"Restored: {restored}")
# Output: Restored: Por favor, envie um email para usuario@exemplo.com informando sobre o CPF 123.456.789-00
üìö Usage Guide
Initialization Options
Python

from aegis_vault import VaultGPT

# Basic initialization (auto-generates encryption key)
vault = VaultGPT()

# With custom encryption key
vault = VaultGPT(encryption_key="your-32-char-secret-key")

# Disable NER for better performance if not needed
vault = VaultGPT(use_ner=False)

# Lazy load spaCy model (load only when needed)
vault = VaultGPT(load_spacy=False)
# Later, when needed:
# vault._load_spacy_model("pt_core_news_sm")
Secure Chat Integration
Python

def query_llm(prompt):
    """Example function to simulate LLM API call"""
    # In a real scenario, this would call your LLM API
    return f"LLM Response to: {prompt}"

# Process sensitive prompts securely
response = vault.secure_chat(
    "Meus dados s√£o: CPF 123.456.789-00, email: usuario@exemplo.com",
    query_llm
)
print(response)
Advanced Features
Custom Patterns
Python

# Add custom patterns for sensitive data
vault.PATTERNS['credit_card'] = r'\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b'

# Add custom malicious patterns to block
vault.MALICIOUS_PATTERNS.append(r'shutdown\s+computer')
Vault Management
Python

# Export vault data (can include encryption key if needed)
json_data = vault.export_vault(include_key=False)  # Don't include key in exports by default

# Save vault to file (encrypted)
vault.save_vault_to_file("secure_vault.json", include_key=False)

# Load vault from file
new_vault = VaultGPT()
new_vault.load_vault_from_file("secure_vault.json")
# Note: You'll need to set the encryption key separately if it wasn't included
