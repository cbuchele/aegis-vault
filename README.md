# aegis-vault
 Aegis Vault is an open-source, developer-first Python library that safeguards sensitive data in AI prompts. Built for legal, enterprise, and security-conscious environments, it detects and encrypts PII (like CPF, CNPJ, emails, IPs, etc.) in real time â€” before sending data to any large language model (LLM).
